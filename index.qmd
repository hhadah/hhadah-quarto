# Welcome to my website!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Houston. My research interest is in Applied Microeconomics primarily in labor economics. I research topics on discrimination, race, identity, mental health, and immigration.

In my free time, I enjoy running with my two dogs, watching college and professional sports, and trying new restaurants in the Houston area.

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:hussainhadah@gmail.com) on my email.
