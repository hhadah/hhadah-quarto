# About Me

I am a labor, health, and education economist and a postdoctoral fellow at Tulane University's [Department of Economics](https://liberalarts.tulane.edu/departments/economics) and [Murphy Institute](https://murphy.tulane.edu/). My research uses causal inference methods, field experiments, and administrative data to evaluate policies and understand economic behavior in contexts such as discrimination, identity formation, peer effects, institutional effectiveness, and public health interventions.

My work addresses critical policy questions with real-world impact. I have published in the *Journal of Economics, Race, and Policy* on how Hispanic surnames affect educational and labor market outcomes, and my ongoing projects examine discrimination in mortgage lending, school admissions, and the role of ethnic perceptions in Hispanic self-identification.

My research on school choice and discrimination, supported by the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) Social Policy Research Initiative, investigates discrimination in admissions across private, charter, and traditional public schools.

I earned my PhD in Economics from the University of Houston in 2023, and graduated with a B.S. in Economics from Arizona State University. 

[Outside](https://hussainhadah.com/personal/) of economics, I enjoy running with my two dogs through New Orleans, following college and professional sports, and exploring the city's incredible culinary scene.

Please feel free to contact me if you have questions about my work or would like to discuss economic research.
