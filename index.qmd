# About Me

I am a post-doctoral fellow at Tulane University's [Department of Economics](https://liberalarts.tulane.edu/departments/economics) and [Murphy Institute](https://murphy.tulane.edu/). 

As an applied economist, I use labor and applied microeconomics techniques to study economic outcomes. My research encompasses areas including discrimination, racial and ethnic identities, health, education and immigration. My recent work has explored the impact of Hispanic surnames on labor and education market prospects, the influence of ethnic perceptions on self-identification among Hispanics, and the role of peer influence on mental well-being.

I am on the 2024/2025 academic job market and am available for interviews. 

I received my PhD in Economics from the University of Houston in 2023. I recieved my BS in Economics from Arizona State University.

Outside of economics, I enjoy running with my two dogs, watching college and professional sports, and trying new restaurants.

Thank you for visiting my website, and I invite you to explore further to learn more about my research and interests.

# Job Market Paper

In my job market paper---[<em>Peer Effects in Adolescent Mental Health</em>](https://hhadah.github.io/Depression_Idea/my_paper/hadah_peer_effects_preprint.pdf)---I explore the impact of peer mental health on adolescents' mental well-being, academic performance, physical health, and behavior. I address the reflection problem in peer effects by employing a friends-of-friends instrument to estimate the influence of peer mental health. I find that a one standard deviation increase in a friend’s mental unwellness leads to a 0.73 standard deviation increase in one’s own mental unwellness. Additionally, the paper highlights the broader negative effects of peer mental health on academic achievement, physical health, and engagement in risky behavior, establishing evidence of social contagion in mental health among adolescents.
