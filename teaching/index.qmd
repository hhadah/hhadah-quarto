## Course Philosophy

My teaching philosophy centers on making economics accessible and relevant to students' lives. I emphasize:

- **Active Learning**: Interactive exercises and real-world applications
- **Data Literacy**: Teaching students to interpret economic research and statistics
- **Policy Relevance**: Connecting economic theory to current policy debates
- **Inclusive Environment**: Creating welcoming spaces for all students to engage with economic concepts
