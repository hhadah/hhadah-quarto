    "text": "About Me\nI am a post-doctoral fellow at Tulane University’s Department of Economics and Murphy Institute.\nAs an applied economist, I use labor and applied microeconomics techniques to study economic outcomes. My research encompasses areas including discrimination, racial and ethnic identities, health, education and immigration. My recent work has explored the impact of Hispanic surnames on labor and education market prospects, the influence of ethnic perceptions on self-identification among Hispanics, and the role of peer influence on mental well-being.\nI am on the 2024/2025 academic job market and am available for interviews.\nI received my PhD in Economics from the University of Houston in 2023. I recieved my BS in Economics from Arizona State University.\nOutside of economics, I enjoy running with my two dogs, watching college and professional sports, and trying new restaurants.\nThank you for visiting my website, and I invite you to explore further to learn more about my research and interests.\n Please feel free to contact me via email.\n Download my curriculum vitae, research statement, diversity statement, and teaching statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nInterests\n\nApplied Microeconomics\nLabor Economics\nEducation Economics\nHealth Economics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n Ph.D. in Economics, 2023University of Houston, Houston, TX\n M.A. in Economics, 2020University of Houston, Houston, TX\n B.S. in Economics (Summa Cum Laude), 2017Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ\n\n\n\n\nJob Market Paper\n\n\nPeer Effects in Adolescent Mental Health\nIn my job market paper—Peer Effects in Adolescent Mental Health—I explore the impact of peer mental health on adolescents’ mental well-being, academic performance, physical health, and behavior. I address the reflection problem in peer effects by employing a friends-of-friends instrument to estimate the influence of peer mental health. I find that a one standard deviation increase in a friend’s mental unwellness leads to a 0.73 standard deviation increase in one’s own mental unwellness. Additionally, the paper highlights the broader negative effects of peer mental health on academic achievement, physical health, and engagement in risky behavior, establishing evidence of social contagion in mental health among adolescents.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Peer effects of friends’ mental health on own mental health, educational, and behavioral outcomes\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Peer effects of friends’ mental health on health, risky behavior, socialization, and alcohol and drug take up\n\n\n\n\nResearch\n\nPublished Work\nWorking Papers\nResearch In Progress\n\n\nPublications\n\nHadah, H.

    "text": "Abstract\nWhat is the effect of democracy on ethnic favoritism? I estimate the relationship between co-ethnicity and five outcomes of public good provision – education, infant health, wealth, access to clean drinking water and access to electricity – using data from twentyone African countries. Following previous research, I use variation in co-ethnicity across ethnic groups and over time. I first estimate the relationship between these five outcomes and co-ethnicity in the full sample and then split the analysis between anocracies and democracies. I find mixed evidence of ethnic favoritism in the full sample. I find more evidence of co-ethnic targeting when comparing within democracies only and within anocracies only."

    "text": "Abstract\nThis paper examines the causal impact of state-level waiting periods for firearm purchases on firearm-related suicide rates. Using variation in waiting period policies across states, we find that these regulations lead to a modest but meaningful reduction in overall firearm suicides, amounting to an average decrease of 0.6 deaths per 100,000 people—an 8% decline, or roughly 2,000 lives saved annually. Notably, the effect is more pronounced among specific demographic groups. Waiting periods reduce firearm suicides by approximately 1.5 per 100,000 among men, 19.3 per 100,000 among individuals aged 55 and older, and 14.7 per 100,000 among White individuals. Our estimates suggest that these life-saving benefits could translate into as much as $37.9 billion in the value of lives preserved. Overall, this analysis provides robust causal evidence that waiting periods for firearm purchases can significantly mitigate suicide risk and generate substantial societal and economic benefits. As a result, policymakers may consider implementing or strengthening waiting period laws as a strategic measure to reduce firearm suicides and improve public health outcomes."

    "text": "Abstract\nThis paper examines how peer mental health influences adolescents’ mental well-being, academic performance, physical health, and behavior. Mental illness is prevalent among children and adolescents, and can have significant consequences on various outcomes. To estimate peer effects, I use the friends-of-friends method. I find that a one standard deviation increase in the mental health index of friends is associated with a 0.73 standard deviation increase in one’s own mental health. Additionally, the paper reveals significant negative effects of peer mental health on academic achievement, physical health, and risky behavior. Overall, this research highlights the importance of understanding peer effects in mental health and its implications for adolescent well-being."

    "text": "Abstract\nDo individuals with Hispanic names face labor market discrimination? This study analyzes the impact of Hispanic-sounding surnames on wages among inter-ethnic children with one White and one Hispanic parent. I find that individuals with Hispanic surnames often earn less, with a notable wage gap favoring those with White surnames. People born to Hispanic fathers and White mothers receive 0.3 years of education less than those born to White fathers and Hispanic mothers. Males born to Hispanic fathers and White mothers earn 5 percentage points less than those born to White fathers and Hispanic mothers, largely due to educational differences. Additionally, men with Spanish-sounding last names who identify as Hispanic earn significantly less, again due to educational disparities."

    "text": "I am a post-doctoral fellow at Tulane University’s Department of Economics and Murphy Institute. I received my Ph.D. in economics from the University of Houston in 2023. I use labor and applied microeconomics techniques to study the intersection of social identities and economic outcomes. My research focuses on discrimination, identity, immigration, education, and health. My primary topics of interest are:\n\nDiscrimination against Minorities and Ethnic Identity\n\nI compared the children of inter-ethnic couples to quantify labor and education markets discrimination against people with Hispanic-sounding last names.\nI examined how state-level variation in bias influences Hispanics’ decisions to identify with, or not identify, their ethnic minority status.\n\nQuantifying Discrimination Using Audit Field Experiments\n\nIn two working papers, I study discrimination using audit field experiments.\nIn one audit, we quantify discrimination in access to the mortgage market against same-sex couples and racial minorities.\nIn another audit, we study discrimination in access to education, with an emphasis on differences between traditional, private, and charter schools against children who are LGBTQI+, racial minorities, have behavioral issues, or have IEP status.\n\nApplied Microeconomics: Education, Labor, and Health\n\nMy applied microeconomics research also includes studying education, labor, and health. This involves analyzing how disparities in access and outcomes across different demographic groups affect labor and education markets, and health outcomes.\nIn other research, I explore the impact of peer mental health on individual mental health outcomes, education, and labor market outcomes."
