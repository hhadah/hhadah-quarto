My research uses causal inference methods, field experiments, and administrative data to evaluate policies and understand economic behavior in contexts such as discrimination, identity formation, peer effects, institutional effectiveness, and public health interventions.\nMy work addresses critical policy questions with real-world impact. I have published in the Journal of Economics, Race, and Policy on how Hispanic surnames affect educational and labor market outcomes, and my ongoing projects examine discrimination in mortgage lending, school admissions, and the role of ethnic perceptions in Hispanic self-identification.\nMy research on school choice and discrimination, supported by the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) Social Policy Research Initiative, investigates discrimination in admissions across private, charter, and traditional public schools.\nI earned my PhD in Economics from the University of Houston in 2023, and graduated with a B.S. in Economics from Arizona State University.\nOutside of economics, I enjoy running with my two dogs through New Orleans, following college and professional sports, and exploring the city’s incredible culinary scene.\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have questions about my work or would like to discuss economic research.\n Please feel free to contact me via email.\n Download my curriculum vitae, research statement, diversity statement, and teaching statement."

    "text": "Abstract\nEthnic identity is typically treated as an immutable demographic attribute in most economic analysis. Motivated by recent work on ethnic attrition, we estimate the causal effect of immigration enforcement on the self-identification of Hispanic children. Exploiting the staggered rollout of the Secure Communities and imputation difference-in-differences method, we find that enforcement reduces self-reported Hispanic identity. This average effect masks a remarkable divergence by generation. While first- and third-generation immigrants retreat from Hispanic identity, second-generation citizens increase identification. We also find larger reductions among college-educated families and no differential effects by sanctuary city. Our results suggest that ethnic identity is not immune to policy, suggesting that policy evaluations must account for ethnic self-identity to avoid conflating policy effects with compositional changes in the target population."

Mental illness is prevalent among children and adolescents, and can have significant consequences on various outcomes. To estimate peer effects, I use the friends-of-friends method. I find that a one standard deviation increase in the mental health index of friends is associated with a 0.73 standard deviation increase in one’s own mental health. Additionally, the paper reveals significant negative effects of peer mental health on academic achievement, physical health, and risky behavior. Overall, this research highlights the importance of understanding peer effects in mental health and its implications for adolescent well-being."

Exploiting SC’s staggered county-level rollout between 2008 and 2013, I use the triple difference-in-differences (DDD) estimator proposed by Borusyak, Jaravel, and Spiess (2024) to identify causal effects. The DDD comparison of Hispanic versus non-Hispanic White populations reveals complex and heterogeneous effects. For adults aged 34+, SC produces a significant overall increase of 0.11 per 100,000. The results are driven by men, who experience substantial increases of 1.21 while women show significant decreases. The gender divergence is particularly pronounced among adults aged 45+, where men show large increases 2.27 representing a 23.5% increase from baseline, while women exhibit sustained decreases. Local contexts significantly moderate these effects: stronger economic conditions provide greater protection, while Democratic-leaning counties experience larger adult suicide rate increases. I find that the mechanisms—and the stark gender gaps—are supported by significant increases in deaths of despair among Hispanic men following SC implementation. Sanctuary policies appear to have neither a mitigating nor a worsening effect on Hispanic suicides. Because Hispanic ethnicity is often underreported in mortality data, these estimates likely understate the true effects, especially for adult men who bear the greatest harm. Overall, immigration enforcement produces complex mental health impacts fundamentally shaped by gender, age, and local economic environments."

This study analyzes the impact of likely Hispanic surnames on wages among Americans with one White and one Hispanic parent. Individuals who likely have Hispanic surnames (i.e. those with a Hispanic father) often complete less education and earn less, with a notable wage gap favoring those with white-sounding surnames. People born to Hispanic fathers and White mothers receive 0.39 fewer years of education than those born to White fathers and Hispanic mothers. Men born to Hispanic fathers and White mothers earn 5 percentage points less than those born to White fathers and Hispanic mothers, and they are 1 percentage point more likely to be unemployed. I also show that this gap can be largely explained by educational differences."

    "text": "Abstract\nIn this paper, I study the determinants of Asian self-identification among individuals whose parents, grandparents, or selves were born in an Asian country. Using a multiple proxy regression approach, I construct a bias measure based on the Implicit Association Test (IAT), the American National Election Studies (ANES), and hate crimes against Asians. I find that individuals with Asian ancestry are significantly less likely to self-identify as Asian if they live in states with high levels of bias: a one standard deviation increase in bias decreases self-reported Asian identity by 9 percentage points across all generations, with effects of 5 percentage points for first-generation (statistically insignificant), 8 percentage points for second-generation, and 8 percentage points for third-generation Asian Americans. Children of mixed-race families show the strongest response, with bias decreasing Asian identity by 15 percentage points among children of Asian fathers and White mothers, and 10 percentage points among children of White fathers and Asian mothers. Multinomial logit results show that higher bias pushes mixed-race adults toward White or multiracial identities rather than Asian-only identification. Parental education and income have modest effects relative to bias. These findings have implications for interpreting research on racial gaps in economic outcomes and population measurement."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nSuicide is often an impulsive act, and in the United States, nearly one-half of suicides involve a firearm, the most lethal and readily available method. In this paper, we use recent developments in difference-in-differences methodology to study the causal effect of waiting-period laws on firearm suicides. We find that waiting periods reduce firearm suicides among men by 1.5 deaths per 100,000 population, an 11% decrease from baseline. For white individuals, we observe a statistically significant reduction of 37.5 deaths per 100,000, a 37% decrease. For adults aged 55 and older, we find a reduction of 25 deaths per 100,000, representing a 40% decrease. For the overall population, we find a statistically significant reduction of 0.92 deaths per 100,000, a 12% decrease from baseline. Crucially, we find no evidence of substitution toward non-firearm suicide methods following waiting period adoption; among men, adults 55 and older, and white individuals, we find significant decreases in non-firearm suicides. We also examine the effects of waiting period repeal and find statistically significant increases in firearm suicides. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest waiting periods prevented approximately 3,000 firearm suicide deaths annually, yielding social benefits of roughly $41 billion. Our findings show that even brief delays in firearm access can disrupt the pathway from suicidal ideation to death, suggesting that cooling-off periods may be an important policy tool for suicide prevention."

I estimate the relationship between co-ethnicity and five outcomes of public good provision – education, infant health, wealth, access to clean drinking water and access to electricity – using data from twentyone African countries. Following previous research, I use variation in co-ethnicity across ethnic groups and over time. I first estimate the relationship between these five outcomes and co-ethnicity in the full sample and then split the analysis between anocracies and democracies. I find mixed evidence of ethnic favoritism in the full sample. I find more evidence of co-ethnic targeting when comparing within democracies only and within anocracies only."

    "text": "I am a labor, health, and education economist currently a postdoctoral fellow at Tulane University’s Department of Economics and Murphy Institute. My research uses causal inference methods, field experiments, and administrative data to evaluate policies and understand economic behavior across diverse contexts including discrimination, identity formation, peer effects, institutional effectiveness, and public health interventions.\n\nDiscrimination against Minorities and Ethnic Identity\n\nI compared the children of inter-ethnic couples to quantify labor and education markets discrimination against people with Hispanic-sounding last names.\nI examined how state-level variation in bias influences Hispanics’ decisions to identify with, or not identify, their ethnic minority status.\n\nQuantifying Discrimination Using Audit Field Experiments\n\nIn two working papers, I study discrimination using audit field experiments.\nIn one audit, we quantify discrimination in access to the mortgage market against same-sex couples and racial minorities.\nIn another audit, we study discrimination in access to education, with an emphasis on differences between traditional, private, and charter schools against children who are LGBTQI+, racial minorities, have behavioral issues, or have IEP status.\n\nApplied Microeconomics: Education, Labor, and Health\n\nMy applied microeconomics research also includes studying education, labor, and health. This involves analyzing how disparities in access and outcomes across different demographic groups affect labor and education markets, and health outcomes.\nIn other research, I explore the impact of peer mental health on individual mental health outcomes, education, and labor market outcomes."
