    "text": "Abstract\nI study the determinants of the choice to identify as Hispanic among those who could—those whose parents, grandparents, or selves were born in a Spanish-speaking country. I find that individuals with Hispanic ancestry are significantly less likely to self-identify as Hispanic if they live in states with high levels of bias. A one standard deviation increase in bias decreases self-reported Hispanic identity by 4 percentage points among all Hispanics. These effects are more prominent among second-generation immigrants with both parents born in a Spanish-speaking country than among children of inter-ethnic parents. These findings have implications for the interpretation of research on ethnic gaps in economic outcomes and the correct counting of the population."

    "text": "Abstract\nThis paper examines how peer mental health influences adolescents’ mental well-being, academic performance, physical health, and behavior. Mental illness is prevalent among children and adolescents, and can have significant consequences on various outcomes. To estimate peer effects, I use the friends-of-friends method. I find that a one standard deviation increase in the mental health index of friends is associated with a 0.73 standard deviation increase in one’s own mental health. Additionally, the paper reveals significant negative effects of peer mental health on academic achievement, physical health, and risky behavior. Overall, this research highlights the importance of understanding peer effects in mental health and its implications for adolescent well-being."

This study analyzes the impact of Hispanic-sounding surnames on wages among inter-ethnic children with one White and one Hispanic parent. I find that individuals with Hispanic surnames often earn less, with a notable wage gap favoring those with White surnames. People born to Hispanic fathers and White mothers receive 0.3 years of education less than those born to White fathers and Hispanic mothers. Males born to Hispanic fathers and White mothers earn 5 percentage points less than those born to White fathers and Hispanic mothers, largely due to educational differences. Additionally, men with Spanish-sounding last names who identify as Hispanic earn significantly less, again due to educational disparities."

I estimate the relationship between co-ethnicity and five outcomes of public good provision – education, infant health, wealth, access to clean drinking water and access to electricity – using data from twentyone African countries. Following previous research, I use variation in co-ethnicity across ethnic groups and over time. I first estimate the relationship between these five outcomes and co-ethnicity in the full sample and then split the analysis between anocracies and democracies. I find mixed evidence of ethnic favoritism in the full sample. I find more evidence of co-ethnic targeting when comparing within democracies only and within anocracies only."

I use labor and applied microeconomics techniques to study the intersection of social identities and economic outcomes. My research focuses on discrimination, identity, immigration, education, and health. My primary topics of interest are:\n\nDiscrimination against Minorities and Ethnic Identity\n\nI compared the children of inter-ethnic couples to quantify labor and education markets discrimination against people with Hispanic-sounding last names.\nI examined how state-level variation in bias influences Hispanics’ decisions to identify with, or not identify, their ethnic minority status.\n\nQuantifying Discrimination Using Audit Field Experiments\n\nIn two working papers, I study discrimination using audit field experiments.\nIn one audit, we quantify discrimination in access to the mortgage market against same-sex couples and racial minorities.\nIn another audit, we study discrimination in access to education, with an emphasis on differences between traditional, private, and charter schools against children who are LGBTQI+, racial minorities, have behavioral issues, or have IEP status.\n\nApplied Microeconomics: Education, Labor, and Health\n\nMy applied microeconomics research also includes studying education, labor, and health. This involves analyzing how disparities in access and outcomes across different demographic groups affect labor and education markets, and health outcomes.\nIn other research, I explore the impact of peer mental health on individual mental health outcomes, education, and labor market outcomes."
