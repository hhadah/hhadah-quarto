    "text": "About Me\nI am a labor, health, and education economist and a postdoctoral fellow at Tulane University’s Department of Economics and Murphy Institute. My research uses causal inference methods, field experiments, and administrative data to evaluate policies and understand economic behavior in contexts such as discrimination, identity formation, peer effects, institutional effectiveness, and public health interventions.\nMy work addresses critical policy questions with real-world impact. I have published in the Journal of Economics, Race, and Policy on how Hispanic surnames affect educational and labor market outcomes, and my ongoing projects examine discrimination in mortgage lending, school admissions, and the role of ethnic perceptions in Hispanic self-identification.\nMy research on school choice and discrimination, supported by the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) Social Policy Research Initiative, investigates discrimination in admissions across private, charter, and traditional public schools.\nI earned my PhD in Economics from the University of Houston in 2023, and graduated with a B.S. in Economics from Arizona State University.\nOutside of economics, I enjoy running with my two dogs through New Orleans, following college and professional sports, and exploring the city’s incredible culinary scene.\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have questions about my work or would like to discuss economic research.\n Please feel free to contact me via email.\n Download my curriculum vitae, research statement, diversity statement, and teaching statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nInterests\n\nApplied Microeconomics\nLabor Economics\nEducation Economics\nHealth Economics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n Ph.D. in Economics, 2023University of Houston, Houston, TX\n M.A. in Economics, 2020University of Houston, Houston, TX\n B.S. in Economics (Summa Cum Laude), 2017Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch\n\nPublished Work\nWorking Papers\nResearch In Progress\n\n\nPublications\n\nHadah, H.

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nSuicide is often an impulsive act, and in the United States, nearly one-half of suicides involve a firearm, the most lethal and readily available method. In this paper, using developments in difference-in-differences design, we study the effect of waiting-period laws on firearm suicides and provide the first causal evaluation of such laws. We find that waiting periods reduce firearm suicides for men (-1.3 per 100,000), while the reduction for the overall population (-0.5 per 100,000), adults aged 55 + (-28.5 per 100,000), and white individuals (-23.1 per 100,000) was statistically insignificant. Waiting periods did not cause an increase in non-firearm suicides. The majority of confidence intervals were in the negative range, and the lack of statistically significant estimates does not mean that waiting periods did not cause a decrease in suicides. These findings provide some evidence that even brief delays in firearm access could disrupt the pathway from suicidal ideation to death, suggesting that cooling-off periods may be a crucial policy tool for suicide prevention."

    "text": "Abstract\nI study the determinants of the choice to identify as Asian among those who could—those whose parents, grandparents, or selves were born in an Asian country. I find that individuals with Asian ancestry are significantly less likely to self-identify as Asian if they live in states with high levels of implicit ethnic bias. A one standard deviation increase in bias decreases self-reported Asian identity by 9 percentage points for all immigrants. A one standard deviation increase in bias decreases self-reported Asian identity by 8 and 9 percentage points for second- and third-generation Asians respectively. These findings have implications for the interpretation of research on racial and ethnic gaps in economic outcomes and the correct counting of the population."

    "text": "Abstract\nDo individuals with Hispanic surnames face discrimination in access to education and the labor market? This study analyzes the impact of likely Hispanic surnames on wages among Americans with one White and one Hispanic parent. Individuals who likely have Hispanic surnames (i.e. those with a Hispanic father) often complete less education and earn less, with a notable wage gap favoring those with white-sounding surnames. People born to Hispanic fathers and White mothers receive 0.39 fewer years of education than those born to White fathers and Hispanic mothers. Men born to Hispanic fathers and White mothers earn 5 percentage points less than those born to White fathers and Hispanic mothers, and they are 1 percentage point more likely to be unemployed. I also show that this gap can be largely explained by educational differences."

    "text": "Abstract\nThis paper examines the causal relationship between immigration enforcement and suicide rates among Hispanic youth, focusing on one of the most significant federal immigration programs of the 21st century: Secure Communities (SC). Using comprehensive mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System, combined with detailed records of SC implementation across counties, I use a difference-in-differences approach that exploits the staggered adoption of SC to identify causal effects. I find a pattern of increased county-level suicide after the implementation of SC, with effects that vary substantially between age groups and sex. The results also highlight the critical importance of considering mental health infrastructure and support systems when implementing immigration policies."

    "text": "Abstract\nThis paper examines how peer mental health influences adolescents’ mental well-being, academic performance, physical health, and behavior. Mental illness is prevalent among children and adolescents, and can have significant consequences on various outcomes. To estimate peer effects, I use the friends-of-friends method. I find that a one standard deviation increase in the mental health index of friends is associated with a 0.73 standard deviation increase in one’s own mental health. Additionally, the paper reveals significant negative effects of peer mental health on academic achievement, physical health, and risky behavior. Overall, this research highlights the importance of understanding peer effects in mental health and its implications for adolescent well-being."

    "text": "Abstract\nWhat is the effect of democracy on ethnic favoritism? I estimate the relationship between co-ethnicity and five outcomes of public good provision – education, infant health, wealth, access to clean drinking water and access to electricity – using data from twentyone African countries. Following previous research, I use variation in co-ethnicity across ethnic groups and over time. I first estimate the relationship between these five outcomes and co-ethnicity in the full sample and then split the analysis between anocracies and democracies. I find mixed evidence of ethnic favoritism in the full sample. I find more evidence of co-ethnic targeting when comparing within democracies only and within anocracies only."

    "text": "I am a labor, health, and education economist currently a postdoctoral fellow at Tulane University’s Department of Economics and Murphy Institute. My research uses causal inference methods, field experiments, and administrative data to evaluate policies and understand economic behavior across diverse contexts including discrimination, identity formation, peer effects, institutional effectiveness, and public health interventions.\n\nDiscrimination against Minorities and Ethnic Identity\n\nI compared the children of inter-ethnic couples to quantify labor and education markets discrimination against people with Hispanic-sounding last names.\nI examined how state-level variation in bias influences Hispanics’ decisions to identify with, or not identify, their ethnic minority status.\n\nQuantifying Discrimination Using Audit Field Experiments\n\nIn two working papers, I study discrimination using audit field experiments.\nIn one audit, we quantify discrimination in access to the mortgage market against same-sex couples and racial minorities.\nIn another audit, we study discrimination in access to education, with an emphasis on differences between traditional, private, and charter schools against children who are LGBTQI+, racial minorities, have behavioral issues, or have IEP status.\n\nApplied Microeconomics: Education, Labor, and Health\n\nMy applied microeconomics research also includes studying education, labor, and health. This involves analyzing how disparities in access and outcomes across different demographic groups affect labor and education markets, and health outcomes.\nIn other research, I explore the impact of peer mental health on individual mental health outcomes, education, and labor market outcomes."
