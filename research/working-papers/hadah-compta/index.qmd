## Abstract

Suicide is often an impulsive act, and in the United States, nearly one-half of suicides involve a firearm, the most lethal and readily available method. In this paper, we use recent developments in difference-in-differences methodology to study the causal effect of waiting-period laws on firearm suicides. We find that waiting periods reduce firearm suicides among men by 1.5 deaths per 100,000 population, an 11% decrease from baseline. For white individuals, we observe a statistically significant reduction of 37.5 deaths per 100,000, a 37% decrease. For adults aged 55 and older, we find a reduction of 25 deaths per 100,000, representing a 40% decrease. For the overall population, we find a statistically significant reduction of 0.92 deaths per 100,000, a 12% decrease from baseline. Crucially, we find no evidence of substitution toward non-firearm suicide methods following waiting period adoption; among men, adults 55 and older, and white individuals, we find significant decreases in non-firearm suicides. We also examine the effects of waiting period repeal and find statistically significant increases in firearm suicides. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest waiting periods prevented approximately 3,000 firearm suicide deaths annually, yielding social benefits of roughly $41 billion. Our findings show that even brief delays in firearm access can disrupt the pathway from suicidal ideation to death, suggesting that cooling-off periods may be an important policy tool for suicide prevention.
