## Abstract

Suicide is often an impulsive act, and in the United States, nearly one-half of suicides involve a firearm, the most lethal and readily available method. In this paper, we use recent developments in difference-in-differences methodology to study the causal effect of waiting-period laws on firearm suicides. We find that waiting periods reduce firearm suicides among men by 1.3 deaths per 100,000 population, a statistically significant effect at the 90\% confidence level. For white individuals, we observe a statistically significant reduction of 21.6 deaths per 100,000 (p-value = 0.09). While the reductions for the overall population (0.47 per 100,000) and adults aged 55 and older (26.3 per 100,000) are not statistically significant, the majority of confidence intervals lie in the negative range, suggesting protective effects. Crucially, we find no evidence of substitution toward non-firearm suicide methods following waiting period adoption. We also examine the effects of waiting period repeal and find no statistically significant increases in firearm suicides, which may indicate persistent protective effects even after policy removal. These findings provide evidence that even brief delays in firearm access can disrupt the pathway from suicidal ideation to death, suggesting that cooling-off periods may be an important policy tool for suicide prevention.
