## Abstract

In this paper, I study discrimination against Hispanics in the labor market. I compare
the children of inter-ethnic marriages to study the impact of having a Hispanic last
name. While males born to Hispanic father-White mothers earn 6 percentage points
less than those born to White father-Hispanic mothers, the gap could be completely
explained by educational differences. I also study the effect of identifying as Hispanic on
earnings. I find that men with a Spanish-sounding last name who identify as Hispanic
earn significantly less than those who do not identify as Hispanic, but the gap could also
be explained by educational differences.
