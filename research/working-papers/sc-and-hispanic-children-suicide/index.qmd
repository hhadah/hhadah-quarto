## Abstract

I estimate the causal impact of the US Secure Communities (SC) program---which greatly expanded deportation risk nationwide---on suicide rates among Hispanic populations. Exploiting SC's staggered county-level rollout between 2008 and 2013, I use the triple difference-in-differences (DDD) estimator proposed by Borusyak, Jaravel, and Spiess (2024) to identify causal effects. The DDD comparison of Hispanic versus non-Hispanic White populations reveals that adults aged 34+ experience increases of 0.5-2.6 suicides per 100,000 in years 2-4 post-implementation. Local contexts significantly moderate these effects: stronger economic conditions provide greater protection, while Democratic-leaning counties experience larger adult suicide rate increases. Sanctuary counties provide enhanced protection for adults (increases of 4.93 vs 2.32) compared to non-sanctuary counties. Because Hispanic ethnicity is often underreported in mortality data, these estimates likely understate the true effects. Overall, immigration enforcement produces complex mental health impacts shaped by age, gender, and local economic and political environments.
