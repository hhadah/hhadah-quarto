## Abstract

This paper examines the causal relationship between immigration enforcement and suicide rates among Hispanic youth, focusing on one of the most significant federal immigration programs of the 21st century: Secure Communities (SC). Using comprehensive mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System, combined with detailed records of SC implementation across counties, I use a difference-in-differences approach that exploits the staggered adoption of SC to identify causal effects. I find a pattern of increased county-level suicide after the implementation of SC, with effects that vary substantially between age groups and sex. The results also highlight the critical importance of considering mental health infrastructure and support systems when implementing immigration policies.
