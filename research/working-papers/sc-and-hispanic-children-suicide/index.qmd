## Abstract

I estimate the causal effect of the US Secure Communities (SC)---a nationwide immigration enforcement program that greatly expanded deportation risk---on suicide rates among Hispanic populations. Using the program's staggered county-level roll-out from 2008 to 2013, I use the Borusyak, Jaravel, and Spiess (2024) method to identify causal impacts. The results reveal heterogeneous effects across age groups: SC led to a 6\% increase in suicide rates among Hispanic children aged 5-14, but an 18\% decrease among Hispanic youth aged 15-24, and a 10\% increase among Hispanic adults aged 34 and older (equivalent to approximately 300 additional deaths annually for this group). Triple difference-in-differences analysis comparing Hispanic to non-Hispanic White populations shows that Hispanic children and adolescents experienced significant decreases in suicide rates relative to their White counterparts, while Hispanic adults showed increases of up to 60\% relative to Whites. Due to likely underreporting of Hispanic ethnicity in vital statistics, my results probably underestimate the true influence of immigration enforcement on mental health outcomes. The analysis reveals significant variations depending on local policy contexts: sanctuary counties generally showed stronger protective effects for younger Hispanic populations but similar or greater adverse effects for older adults compared to non-sanctuary counties. The results reveal that aggressive immigration enforcement has complex, age-specific impacts on mental health, with particularly concerning effects on older Hispanic adults.
