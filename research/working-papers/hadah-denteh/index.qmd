## Abstract

We study how the Secure Communities (SC) program altered Hispanic children's ethnic self-identification in the American Community Survey.
Leveraging staggered SC roll-out across counties, we implement a difference-in-differences strategy to track identification patterns for first- through fourth-generation children. We find that exposure to SC reduces the likelihood that Hispanic children report as Hispanic, with attrition concentrated among children of highly educated parents. Attrition appears across every generation we study, spanning first- through fourth-generation youth. Comparisons across sanctuary and non-sanctuary jurisdictions yield similar declines, indicating that local sanctuary policies do not offset SC-driven identity loss.
