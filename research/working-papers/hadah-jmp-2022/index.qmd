## Abstract

In this paper, I study the determinants of the choice to identify as Hispanic among
those who could—those whose parents, grandparents, or selves were born in a Spanishspeaking country. I find that individuals with Hispanic ancestry are significantly less
likely to self-identify as Hispanic if they live in states with high levels of implicit ethnic bias. A one standard deviation increase in bias decreases self-reported Hispanic identity by 7-13 percentage points for first and second-generation Hispanics, respectively. These effects are more prominent among second-generation immigrants whose mothers and
fathers were born in a Spanish-speaking country than among children of inter-ethnic
parents. These findings have implications for the interpretation of economic research
on racial and ethnic gaps in a variety of contexts, including labor market outcomes,
redistributive policies, and political representation.
